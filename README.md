Summary
SRP: One class, one responsibility.
OCP: Extend behavior without modifying existing code.
LSP: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
ISP: Use small, specific interfaces.
DIP: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
These principles ensure modularity, scalability, and easier testing, making your code base cleaner and more maintainable
